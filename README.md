I would like to change my career and become a GoLang developer, I believe the best way to do this is to showcase examples of what I am working on. As GoLang is one of the newer languages I'm excited to learn it but due to other commitments progress is slow.

The plan is to put something down each week and have something to show for it in a years time. At the moment I am working as an Application Support Specialist dealing with a huge financing software, on this basis it can be said I am familiar with the IT world.
