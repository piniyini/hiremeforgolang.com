# Let's get started shall we?

The proper way to get started with installing GoLang is here [golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install) but I prefer to use [Cloud9](http://c9.io) due to their ease of use. If you've never used C9 before you're in for a real treat.

## Cloud9

Select a new workspace, fill in the details and select Public workspace. The best thing about Public is that no one can see your files (depite the name public) as the workspace powers down when you are not using it.

Select Ubuntu as shown below, best thing is Go comes pre-installed as soon as it loads up.
